## Summary

### Goal

Enable solar sales representatives from Palmetto partner organizations to generate HVAC quotes for homeowners in real-time during in-home consultations, facilitating a seamless cross-sell opportunity that drives value for both the solar installation and HVAC upgrade sale.

### Scope

This design covers Phase 1 (Sales) of the Palmetto partnership user journey, specifically:

- User authentication and team management
- Address entry and digital twin generation
- Housing details confirmation
- Energy usage visualization and editing
- Quote customization (commission, equipment, notes)
- Product selection and comparison
- Checkout flow (payment method, scheduling, quote sharing)

- Homeowner-facing project status view
- Change order management

### Out of Scope

- Phase 2: Install operations (handled by Sibi)
- Phase 3: Payment processing and reconciliation (handled by Tetra backend)
- Material ordering workflow (handled by Sibi)
- Palmetto financing application integration (external system)

## Jobs to be Done

| Job Category | Job Statement |
|--------------|---------------|
| Quote Generation | When I identify an HVAC opportunity, I want to quickly generate an accurate quote so I can close the deal while the homeowner is engaged. |
| Equipment Selection | When I need to recommend HVAC equipment, I want to see only available options with real-time pricing so I can confidently present options to the homeowner. |
| Commission Management | When I need to adjust pricing for a deal, I want to easily modify my commission so I can maintain competitiveness while protecting my earnings. |
| Customer Communication | When a homeowner wants to review later, I want to send them the quote via email or text so they can make an informed decision at their convenience. |
| Deal Closing | When the homeowner is ready to proceed, I want to collect payment method, deposit, and schedule installation so I can complete the sale in one visit. |
| Team Management | When I onboard new sales reps, I want to easily add them to the system with appropriate permissions so they can start selling immediately. |
| Change Orders | When install requirements change, I want to communicate the price impact to the homeowner and get approval so the project can continue without delays. |

## Primary Apps

### Existing Apps Used

| App | Role in This Design |
|-----|---------------------|
| Quoting Tool | Core application adapted for solar sales rep use. Provides address entry, digital twin, equipment selection, and quote generation. |
| Homeowner Dashboard | Extended to serve as the post-sale Success Page, showing project status and timeline to homeowners. |

### New Functionality Required

| Feature | Justification | Primary Purpose |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| User Management Module | Existing quoting tool lacks team management. Solar orgs need to manage their own sales reps. | Add/remove users, set commission defaults, manage permissions |
| Customizations Screen | Existing tool lacks in-flow customization. Sales reps need to adjust quotes without leaving the flow. | Commission adjustment, equipment sizing, condenser addition, installer notes |
| Scheduling Integration | Current quoting tool does not include install scheduling. Required to close deals in one visit. | Display available install windows, capture preferred time |
| Change Order Screen | No existing mechanism for post-sale modifications. Critical for handling install-day discoveries. | Display change details, get approval, capture additional payment method |

---

### Design Notes

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Configuration bar establishes context immediately
- Hero section drives emotional engagement with benefit-focused messaging
- Tech specs serve as reference material for detail-oriented buyers
- Sticky footer ensures CTA is always accessible

**Content Strategy:**
- Lead with benefits (hero), follow with proof (what's included, trust indicators)
- Technical details available but not primary focus
- FAQ addresses objections proactively
- Alternative options reduce fear of wrong choice

**Mobile Considerations:**
